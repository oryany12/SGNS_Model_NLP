Hey, you don't like the way I'm talking.
Hey, so you stand there keep on call me names.
No, I'm not your enemy so.
If you're gonna do it, don't do it.
Hey, do you wanna check my DNA?
Older stories, time to go away.
And believe in fairytales, oh.
If you're gonna do it.

I'm gonna stand here like a unicorn.
Out here on my own.
I got the power of a unicorn.
Don't you ever learn?
That I won't look back, I won't look down.
I'm going up, you better turn around.
The power of a unicorn, the power of a unicorn.

History caught in a loop.
Don't you wanna change it?
You know that we can, you and me.
Can write a new book.
Don't you wanna change it now?
